## Taxonomy
  _broadly_: taxonomy is the discipline at the core of biological discoveries and classifcation is its most direct product, it provides the means of constructing biological classifications. One weakness however is that the elements (chosen features) can be subjective and controversial.  
  _narrowly_: science of **discovering**, **describing**, and **naming** taxa and **groups** of related taxa 
## Systematics 
  _narrowly_: study of biological diversity and discovery of relationships among all organisms, both extant and extinct. This field requires **reconstructing the evolutionary history**, is done by splitting populations to the deepest phylogenetic divergences (which can include fossils), and **endeavors to onvey knowledge of the tree of life through classification**.  
  
taxonomy has commonly been equated to the field of systematics due to their similarities in both studying biological entities and their genealogical relationships. 

## History of Taxonomy
#### Beginnings 
Started in 3000 BC in China, endeavored to describe the useful properties of plants (pharmacopoeia). Also in 1500 BC Egypt.  
#### Classic World Taxonomy
**Plato**(427-347 BC) thought of classification in the sence of _artificial_ vs _natural kinds_, however; he did not provide any procedures for finding natural kinds as he did think there were such procedures.  

**Aristotle**(384-322 BC) had a more empirical view and tried to address these _natural kinds_.  
- A group is real if it has an _essence_ and a _final cause unique to itself_
- A species (or any other taxonomic group) is what is it is because of the expression of this essence.
- Developed the philosophical foundations for classification based on _being_, and introduced the concepts of **substance, genus (_genos_) and species (_edios_)**
    - Taxa can be defined by characteristics arising out of its essence, falling into two categories:
        1. _Definition_: Characteristics which the species shares with other member-species of the genus
        2. _Differentiae_: Unique characters which distinguish each species member
      
Basically, Aristotle believed that each entity has _an essential feature_ or essence which in turn defines the type of entity in question. This had a great influence on taxonomist throughout the 19th-20th centuries. Its also of note that the classifications based on the _Definition_ and _Differentiae_ were based on relatively few characters which were often selected _a priori_ based on ideas of functional importance.  

By his defintions: a taxon is _natural_ if the organisms placed in that taxon agree in characters that embody the **essence** of the group.  

**Scala Naturae** the "Great Chain of Being" (_ladder thinking_): Aristotle believed that groups could be arranged in _series_ according to their _honor, excellence, or nobility_
- This was the first attempt at classfiying life: the entire natural world could be arranged in a single continuum.
- Established the concept that **species are immutable and never change**

#### Pre-Linnaean Taxonomy
**Caspar Bahuin** (1560-1624)
- Descibed about 6000 plant species, assigning many names that were later adopted by Linnaeus (many remaining to this day)
- Experimented with the nomenclature: would prune the **descriptions** down to a few words and concatenated it with the genus, his intention was to assign a short diagnostic label to each organism (rather than a formal name)

**Conrad von Gesner** (1516-1565)
- First significant contribution to pre-Linnaean taxonomy

**Andrea Cesalpino** (1519-1603)
- Classified plants according to plants and seeds

**Joseph Pitton de Tournefort** (1656-1708)
- First to generate a clear idea of the concept of genus

**Augustus Quintinus Rivinus** (1652-1723)
- Introduced 'higher ranks' (orders) - better structured classification

**Jan Swammerdam** (1637-1680)
- First important treatement of insect taxonomy

**John Ray** (1627-1705)
- Discussed the term _species_, which he defined as a group of organisms capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring. His taxonomy used multiple morphilogical characters to classify species.
- What is the term of species, variation was poorly understood and therefore all variation needed to be accounted for. John started to suggest that maybe there was some tolerance for what is a species. Measure of what variance could be tolerated for a "species" 

#### Linneaeus's Taxonomy
Tried to define order (synthesis) to classification.  
Based his criteria on two assumptions:
  1. **Species are immutable** - Creationism
  2. Categories are **defined** by their attributes (traits) - Essentialism
Constructed nested hierarchies: Empire, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species (binomial).
These classes are abstract classes (categories). Some sort of logical relationships not natural 

#### Post-Linnaean taxonomy
Essentialism held things back, holistic analysis and variation was needed (nature was not static), species must be mutable (pre-Darwin). Things mutate over time. 
A trade-off existed when classifiying characters: Either all characters were to be treated equally, or some were given a posterior weighting (based on their correlation with other characters and pattern variation) which could be argued to induce subjectivity.  

Life did not all fit on one ladder. There remained the critical misinterpretation that living groups gave rise to more advanced groups (e.g. Lamarack), as such this portrayed a scale of being from extant groups rather than descent from common ancestry.  

#### Darwin
Influential, synthesized what many had already noted and provided a plausible mechanism for evolution to operate by. 
- Natural processes give rise to species
- species are not static classes (not the so called immutable structures, he didn't really even believe in the so called 'rank' of species)

#### Post-Darwinian Phylogenetics 
Things shifted towards _intuitive_ evolutionary concepts  
Bessey's Cactus: evolutionary tree (for plants) through extant groups orginated from extant groups (still violating with ladder thinking).
- Developed a set of rules stating which characters were primitive and advanced in flowering plants
Zimmermann:  How do we formalize the ideas what Darwin talked theorized about. Monophyletic groups, stems, trees, etc. Made a clear distinction:  (contain this trait), Idealistic (what we think, not represntative on nature), Phylogenetic (based on genealogies). Talked how much the phylogenetic had to offer. 
			Willi Hennig: Entomologist, considered the founder of phylogenetic systematics.
