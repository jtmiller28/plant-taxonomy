Hybridization, Introgression, Polyploidy

Hybridization: cross between different genotypes in a population, also grafting...mess of definitions
Stebbins: crossing between individuals belonging to sperate populations which have different adapative norms. 
Genetic engineering = hybrids? (not) its just moving genes 
Horizontal Gene Transfer: (not hybdridization) Lateral Gene Transfer: the movement of genetic material between incellualr and multicellualr organisms other than by the vertical transmission of dan from parent to offspring. Moves great distances (can).
	- Classic example: Parastism (intracellular connections). 

First artificial cross: Tragopogon

Hybrids and hubrid swarms:
hybrid swarms: Cross with eachother, cross with parents: basically a mess/mix. 
intermediate habitats are thought to be important to allow persistence and success of hybrids. 

Long thought that hybridization is important for plants more so than animals. 
- Alot more common then we thought.

Introgression
- is the movement of a genes from one species into a gene pool to another by backcrossing. 
- Adaptive introgression is questionable...

Homoploid hybrid speciation: Not common
unusual. Hybridization between taxa at the same ploidal level. Its a hybrid that is isolated from parents (speciation). 
Requires chromosomal changes. (seems like semantics...what is a species anyway though). 

Polyploidy:
Generates genetic and source of phenotypic novelty. 
All extant flowering plants of polyploid origin
most major crops are polyploid 
Hundreds of ancient WGCs have been identified. 
Some acient WGDs can be mapped to geologic events. 
Great responder to stress (hypothesis) 
- allopolyploid AA + BB = AABB
- autopolyploid AA + AA = AAAA

Cyteny: ways to check for WGD, since it shows retainment of the alignment.
