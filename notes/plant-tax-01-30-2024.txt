Vascular Plants (Tracheophytes)
Major shift in life cycles to Diploid sporophyte dominance. 

Polyspragiophytes: Only a group distinct when we include some fossils, really arent used that often, but they do hold some interesting synapomorphies (green sporophyte), independent & branching sporophyte. Sporophyte is dominant, but there are also independent gametophyte in some cases. These fossil lineages dont have vascular tissue. 
Aglaophyton - lacks vascular tissue, has sporophytes, had independent and somewhat large gametophyte. 

Tracheophytes: We're talking about vascular plants, so were talking about plants with a conducting system. 
Major Synaps
- Independent, branched sporophyte 
- Xylem with trachieds 

Tracheids: special elongated cells taht condut water
- allowed plants to move into drier habitats 
- provieded structural support, allows you to grow taller. 
- major innovation in plant evolution. Prior things were small and not able to establish in many enviroments 

Phylogeny of the Tracheophytes:
- Xylem with tracheids is the synapomorphy for this group
- After reinophytes, synapomorphy is lignin in the cell walls, which allows a for a major shift in morphology (structural stability) 
- After this, we have a split between the lycophytes and the nymilophytes(?)

Lycophytes: 
- cooksonia is the sister group to the rest of the Lycophytes. Depopurate group today, many lineages here are extinct. 
- 410 mya highlights just how fast diversification for vascular plants occurred. 
- Fossil record back to the eraly Devonian (354-417mya) 
- small today (can be viney), but there are some tree-like fossils Lepidodendron
	Lepidodendron	
		- Started in Devonian, Abundant in the Carbonifernous 
		- Contributed to the vast swamps, contributed to the coal we mine today
		- Dichotomous branching (even roots) 
		- Composite view from assembly of "organ genera"
- Dichotomous branching 
- true leaves = microphylls (mosses and liverwarts DONT have leaves, they can be unvascularized flaps of tissue) 
	- Small (usually) leaves with one unbranched vein
		Microphylls
			- Has vascular tissue, if it doesnt its a "scale"

	Living Lycophytes ~ 1200 species
		- Lycopodiaceae
			- 1 genera
			- Homosporous 
			- Leaves lack a ligule
		- Selaginellaceae + Isoetaceae
			- 1 genera
			- Heterosporous 
			- Leaves have a ligule: small flap of tissue that occurs on the surface on the leaf (ligule just means a flap of tissue of sometype) 
				Homosporous 
					- A single type of spore
					- Spore germinates to form a potentially bisexual gametophyte
				Heterosporous 
					- Two types (usually sizes) of spores
					- Spores from unisexual gametophyte
				- Heterospory has originated several times...
					- Microspores are dispersed by wind typically
					- Megasporagium can stay on parent plant and germinate into a megagametophyte. 
Terminology: 
Strobilus: A temrinal cluster of sporophylls (spore bearing leaves) (looks like a cone) 

Lycophyte Diversity
	- Lycopodium 
		- Club Moss, running cedar
		- Highly flammable spores
		- Fossils lepidodendron: this name only really applies to the stem, "organ genera" Lepidodendron (stem), Lepidophyllpodes (leaves), Stigmaria (rhizome), Stigmarai (rhizome), Lepidocarpon (megasporangiate strobilus) a single sporophyll with a megasporangium ith a single megaspore, protected by tissue (very very close independent evolution of the seed). Lepidostrobus (microsporangiate strobilus) 
			- Interestingly the microphylls (simple with one vein) have been found to be a meter long...no found in any extant microphyll.  
	- Diphasiastrum has been segregated, but after molecular sampling we dont think these are monophyletic. 
	- No branched veins

Euphyllophytes
	- Pseudomonopodial growth
	- Chloroplast DNA
	- Multiflagellete sperm
		- Two Major Clades
			- Monilophytes (ferns)
			- Seed plants (spermatophytes) (lignaphytes) 
	- Synapomorphies
		- Multiflagellate sperm
		- Overtopping = pseudomonopodial growth (main step axis with side axes)
		- Chloroplast DNA inversion, phylogenetic marker of a inversion in the early vascular plants.
Overtopping can lead to planation and webbing which results in a megaphyllous leaf. 

Most Euphyllophytes have Megaphylls rather than microphylls (Eu = true) 
- Most have large and more than one veined leaves
- Vascularture of the stem is a cylinder: microphyllous leaf there is a vein that connects the cylinder to the leaf (continuous). In contrast, in a megaphyll it takes alot more vasculature to connect the leaf to the cylinder stem. This creates a "gap" between the leaf veination and the main stem's cylinder. Look at a picture of this...


Monilopyhytes: Characteristic stem anatomy: 
Clade is well supported by DNA data
- Sort of a hogepog of groups that dont really look like they fall together. 
- within here are the actual ferns 
- Sometimes fern is restricted to a particular group or just all of the monilophytes. 
	- Ferns 12,000 species
		- Psilotales  	 "whisk ferns"
		- Ophioglossales "ferns"
		- Equisetophytes
		- Mar

Psilotales and Ophioglossales are sister groups
Equisetophytes: some are highly branched that are highly photosynthesized, some produce non-photosynthetic stems with strobulus
Leptosporangiate ferns: what we often think of as a fern 
"Pteridophytes" <- not good, this is them creating two classifications for the lycophytes and monilophytes

Psilotails
	Psilotum - 12sp, dichotomous branching, in tropics, enations (prophylls, no vasculature, not a ligule (hasnt been called this but matches definition...)), Synangium : 3 sporangium fused toghether, epiphyte (no roots) ryzome, photosynthetic gametophyte, dichotomous branching gametophyte (not as small as most fern gametophyte)
	Tmesipteris - 2 or 3 sp: Not really leaves, Synangium occurs by 2 fused sporangia 
Ophioglassales 
	Ophioglossaceae - Adder's tongue family
		- 4 genera
		- 70-90 sp
		- Botrychium
		- 
		- Highest chromosome number, polyploid 2n = 1260....
		- Each leaf is divided with a sterile photosynthetic part and a reproductive part that bears the sporangia 
Equisetophytes
	Equisetaceae
		one genus Equisetum: 15 sp
		silica concentrated in stems, 'scouring rush' 
		distinctive grooved, hollow stems
		distinctive spores with elaters
		whorled leaves
		two subgenera 
		Strobilus - each piece is called a sporangiophore -> have the sporangium that produce the spores, the spores contain an Elater that aids in dispersal. Produces a photosynthetic gametophytes

Maratialles 
Marattiaceae (only 1 fam) 
- 6 genera 
- large tree like
- living fossil, largely unchanged

Leptosporangiate ferns
	- Go all the way back to the carboniferous 
	- Marvelous megaphylls
	- Fiddle heads (way for leaf to be in bud) (those coiled leaves that unroll)
	- Leptosporangium 
		- Unique to this group
		- small
		- thin walled	
		- prodduce usually 64 spores (min 16, 32 occassionally)
	- Lots of diversity 
	- Annulus catapults the spores
	- Sporangia are located in clusters called sori on the backs of the leaves 
	- Sorus covered by indusium as a protective cover (indusia) indusia are often used as taxonomic markers. 
	- Marsileales::Marsileaceae: water ferns heterospry
	- Salvinaceae heterospry
	- Fossil record goes back to the Carboniferous, the diversification times are however relatively recent. "Diversified in the shadow of the angiosperms".
