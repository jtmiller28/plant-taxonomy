Angiosperms 

Angiosperms are one of the greatest terrestrial radiations 
	Ecologically dominant 
	Economic importance
Angiosperm - "angio" = vessel, receptacle 
	Dominant gorup of land plants 
	sister group to extant gymnosperms
	fossil record 135 mya (prob older) 

Gymno vs Angio 
Ovule is enclosed in a structure, + 2 integuments (angio) vs 1 integument (gymno) 

Are living gymnosperms monophyletic 
	- closest relatives of angios is the living gymnosperms 
	- Extinct gymnosperms not so much....no more seed ferns
	- these were on the road to angiosperms
Caytoniales 
	- the ovules were encclosed in another structure: so they thought it might be the road to the secodn integument 

Angiosperm features
- seeds within a carpel
- pollination involves tranfer of of pollen to stigma (rather than micropyle)
- Reduced megagametophyte
- double fertilization - formation of endosperm
- vessel elements (when did they oriinate?)
- flower <- nebulous
- ovule with two integuments
- Male Gametophyte

Flower is an ambigious term

Stamen = really a leaf....with sporoangia on them = microsporophyll
Carpel = modified megasporophyll 
Placentation = where the ovules are attached.

Redcuced gametophytes 
- Double fertilization 
- 8 nuclei 
- pollen grain must land on the stigma (as the micropile is enclosed), pollen grain lands and sends down to pollen tube, one of the sperm nuclei (of the two) unites with with one nuclei forming 2n the other unites with with the central cell (pollar nuclie 1n + 1n + 1n) to form 3n

Pollen:

the distance the pollen tube has to travel pretty dang far. 
Double fertilization 
1 sperm + egg = zygote 2n 

Fruit = ripened ovary
Fruit types = useful for classification

Keys to Domiance of the Angiosperms 
- Protection of seeds in an ovary/fruit
- Diseprsal of seeds via fruits 
- Rapid completion of reporduction
- Endosperm as nutrient tissue for embryo (polyploid provides more nutrition) 
- Water transport via vessels - more efficient* We no longer think they orinated with angio
- More efficient conducting cells in phloem  

Vessel elements 
- first angios probably didnt have these 

Rapid rise and eaerly diversification
- Fossil record looks like a huge boom 
- Fossil records
	- Floral diversity in early cretaceous
	- Pollen ~ 130mya
	- Mahor lineages occurred quickly
	- ecological dominance

Early cretaceous angiosperms
	- Archaefructus (used to be thought of as the oldes angiosperm) 

Molecular data can give us some estimates 

Triassic ?

Angiosperm Phylogeny - History
- Drawing the cactus 
- angiosperm phylogeny: Cronquist, Takhtajan, Thorne, Dahlgren 
- Taking a bunch of characters and bring them together (without phylogenetic information) 
- Morphological characters often just dont work...causes issues 

- There seems to be multipple bursts of radiations: rapid evolution (taking over 

APG is based on the plastid genome (nuclear is adding different information) 

Basal angiosperms (Amborella is sister to the rest of the flowering plants), 
vessels probably arose after flowering plants (Amborella doesnt have it) 

First angiosperms: Maybe the first flowering plants were woody and grew in dark and distrubed ecosystems (in the conifer forests). All angiosperms were woody, they could of also been aquatic (cant really say one or the other definitely). 

Floral Evolution 
Magnolia - Traditionally viewed as the early flower
Current: Amborella and Illicium (much more diminished, parts were spirally arranged and hard to differentiate)

Amborella trichopoda
Shrub, New caledonia, 
Small flowers, 
Spiral arrangment 
moderate number of parts - varies unlike monocots
undifferentiated periant - Tepals 
leaf like laminar stamens 

Nymphaeales - Nymphaeaceae 
Early flowers - key points so far? 
	- Tepals 
		moderate to numerous in number, spiral arrangement 
	- Stamens numerous - often laminar
	- Carpels moderate to many 

Mesagngiosperms - Big bang (everything after amoborella, water lilies, and something) 
- Less than 5 million years resulted in the big lineages arising 

Magnoliids
Magnoliales
Laurales 
Canellales 
Piperales 

Eudicots 
- Chloranthaceae 
- 'Dicots' are not monophyletic
- 75% of the flowering plants
- Pollen has 3 apitures/grooves (distinguishes the Eudicots) = Triaperturate pollen 
- Gunneridae are sister to the core eudicots 

Pentapetalae - parts 5 was locked in 
- supergroups: superrosidae, superasteridae
- Saxifragales - dna put these together , no obvious synapomorphies 
- Dilleniaceae - diverse array of features that is challenging to place correctly 
- Rosid clade - Contains many of the tropic and temprate forest trees, rise of the rosid forest changed the terrestrial ecosystems 
	- Caused large radiations of many many groups (in

Asterids - Fused petals for most. 
Monocots have lots of synapomorphies but parts in 3s isnt just the ultimate distinguisher
